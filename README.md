🎓  Graduated from [Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.ironhack.com/en/web-development), where I acquired skills like **HTML | CSS | JavaScript(ES6) | React | ExpressJS | MongoDB | NodeJS | Axios | Handlebar**.

🌱  I’m currently learning **TypeScript | Jest | Solidity | Utility-first CSS**. 

😎  I enjoy building web applications that **boost productivity**, make life more **fun** and have **positive impact on our society**. 

   - An app I developed to have fun in learning foreign languages: [Viking Invasion](https://tkyngw.github.io/viking-invasion/)
     
   - An app I developed with two others for more transparancy in working environment: [Architrap](http://architrap.herokuapp.com/)
     
   - An app I developed to tackle a sustainable mobility issue in Berlin: [Berlin Bicycle Station](https://berlinbikestation.herokuapp.com/)

👀  I'm interested in [Web3](https://ethereum.org/en/web3/) and excited about how it'll shape our future.
